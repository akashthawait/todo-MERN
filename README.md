# todo-MERN
Simple ToDoApp List Using MERN Stack

For now I have created a simple rest API without any authentication, but will later add authentication via middlewares

Clone this App on your local machine

Then go to backend folder and do npm install

Again back to root folder and go to todo-client folder and do npm install

To Run the code you have to seperately run both backend and todo client my using npm start
